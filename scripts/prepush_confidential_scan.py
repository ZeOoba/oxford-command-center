"""Git pre-push confidentiality gate (Hard Invariant 3) -- fail-closed.

This repo is PUBLIC (Gabriel ruling 2026-11-09), so it is an external surface: no active
confidential deal may reach it before closing. This gate scans everything a push would make
new on the remote and BLOCKS if any active deal's term from the machine-local roster
(~/.claude/hooks/confidential-terms.json, never committed anywhere) appears in it: an
`always` term anywhere, or a `context` term together with one of that deal's
`context_requires_any` anchors in the same window (see "Context terms" below).

Ported from ~/.claude/hooks/git-prepush-confidential-scan.py (the ora-claude-config gate,
which has carried this design since 2026-06-11), terms-only: that gate's credential scan
depends on ~/.claude/hooks/lib/secret_patterns.py and is not ported. The same file is
committed to ora-skills, website-canonical and ora-pm; keep the three copies identical.

What is scanned, per pushed ref:
  * every commit object in the range, raw (message, author, mergetag and other headers), and
    `git log -p --cc` over the range (every diff; a clean HEAD does not mean a clean push);
  * EVERY blob the range adds or modifies, read whole via `git cat-file --batch` and
    classified by content, never by extension or git's binary flag (which `.gitattributes`
    can flip). Views: utf-8, cp1252, UTF-16 LE/BE at byte offsets 0 and 1; markup with tags
    stripped and HTML entities decoded (a Word run split across `<w:t>` elements still
    matches); gzip / bz2 / xz / zip / tar decompressed in memory, nested to a small depth
    (docx / xlsx are zips);
  * the pushed ref names, and every annotated tag object in a pushed tag's chain; when a
    pushed ref or tag chain ends at a BLOB it is scanned like a pushed file, and at a TREE
    every blob in it (`ls-tree -r`, all of them -- blobs already on the remote included);
    any other non-commit type blocks;
  * every path, ref name and file name as raw bytes through the same text views, so a
    cp1252 / UTF-16 path is read too.
Every git call runs with `--no-replace-objects` and GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS=1 (and without
GIT_REPLACE_REF_BASE): `git replace` must not show the scan a different object from the one
pack-objects sends.
Every text is also read URL-decoded (`unquote_plus` and plain `unquote`, so `%20`, `+` and
`%51uiet` decode), repeated to a fixpoint bounded at 4 rounds, which unwraps up to four
levels of encoding (`%20`, `%2520`, `%252520`, `%25252520`); deeper nesting is a residual.
URL-decoding runs on the raw and the entity-decoded text (tag-stripped readings are not
URL-decoded), so an encoded term inside an `href` attribute is read too. Plain `unquote`
(which keeps a literal `+`) is only run when some roster string contains `+`; otherwise it
can find nothing `unquote_plus` does not.
Cost versus origin/main, measured best of 3 on 4 MB texts with an anchored roster:
clean ASCII 1.1x; dense `+ % & <` (`a+b%2Bc%252Bd...&amp;amp;<i>x</i>`) 3.7x, 7.7x when a
roster string contains `+`; %-only 6.1x; accented non-ASCII text 7.9x (the guard-tight
anchor reading: NFKD over every non-ASCII window). The earlier refute pass measured 3.4x /
5.0x / 3.4x on 30d2a246, before the tight anchor reading existed.
Matching: NFKC + casefold on both sides; any run of whitespace / `_` / `-` / `.` / NBSP
counts as one separator, and a separator-free form of each MULTI-word term (5+ chars) is
also matched against the normalized text, so `LOI_<TermNoSpaces>_MMDDYYYY` and line-wrapped
or `&nbsp;`-joined names are caught without "east on" matching a one-word "easton".
Range: an existing remote ref scans remote_sha..local_sha (git took remote_sha from the
destination itself). A brand-new remote ref scans the pushed commits NOT reachable from what
the destination actually advertises: `git ls-remote <push url>` (argv[2], or argv[1] when
argv[2] is absent; no prompt, 60 s timeout, credential helpers inherited), keeping only the
advertised shas that exist locally as commits, passed as `^<sha>` lines on `--stdin` (no
command-line cap). No local tracking ref is consulted. The bound is REFUSED (full scan)
unless ls-remote would provably ask the repository the push goes to: the target must
resolve to itself (`ls-remote --get-url` -- git already applied url.*.insteadOf to argv[2],
and a second pass through a self-matching rule or a rule chain would ask another repo),
argv[1] must not set remote.<name>.receivepack / uploadpack, and the target must be a plain
file / ssh / http(s) / git URL or path (no `<helper>::` or `ext::` syntax). If ls-remote
fails, times out or advertises nothing usable, the pushed ref's FULL history is scanned -- fail-closed, and slower; an orphan branch or a push to an empty repository is
likewise scanned in full. This costs one extra connection to the remote per push that
creates a ref.

Context terms (mirrors find_hit() in ~/.claude/hooks/confidentiality-guard.py): a deal's
`context` term blocks only when one of the same deal's `context_requires_any` anchors also
appears in the same WINDOW. A window is one scanned unit:
  * one commit: its raw object in every text view, its own patch from `git log -p`, AND the
    content and path of every blob it adds or modifies (`git log --raw`, merges via --cc) --
    binary, archive and `-diff` files show in the patch only as "Binary files differ", so
    their decoded text is pooled in explicitly (the guard pools file_path with content);
  * one blob: every text view, every decompressed archive member (a docx is one document)
    and every path it is pushed under;
  * one annotated tag object; one pushed ref name.
An anchor and a context term that only meet across two commits of the same push do not
combine (residual; the anchored-context design is about one text).
A deal whose context terms have no usable anchor -- `context_requires_any` missing or empty,
or ANY anchor with no match form once tightened and normalized (`normalize(_guard_tight(a))`
is empty: separators and invisibles only, e.g. `<WORD JOINER>-`), or blank under the guard's
tight form (NFKD, lowercase, superscript
digits, combining marks (Mn) and the guard's invisible set _TABLE_FMT deleted, whitespace
collapsed: U+3164, U+2800, U+115F/1160, U+0301, U+FE0F, ZWSP ... all count as blank; a
blank anchor matches everywhere, as in the guard) -- has its context terms treated as
`always` terms. That is stricter than the guard for a missing / empty anchor list, which the
guard reads as "never fires"; fail-closed wins here. An anchor made only of separators
(`-`, `_`, `.`) has no match form and counts as blank too. Each usable anchor is matched in
its plain normalized form AND its tight form, against the normalized text AND the guard's
tight form of the raw / entity-decoded text, so `projectcode<ZWSP>q7` in the roster fires on
`projectcodeq7`, `projectcode<WORD JOINER>q7` or a stray combining mark in the text still
fires, and an accented anchor fires with or without the accent, as the guard does (its
punctuation and non-ASCII digit folds are not mirrored). An anchor alone never blocks.

Output never echoes a term: hits are reported as roster indices, and a path or ref name
that itself contains ANY roster string (always, context or anchor) is withheld.

FAIL-CLOSED -- each of these BLOCKS the push:
  * roster missing, unreadable, unparseable, not a JSON object, or any deal entry malformed
    (a non-dict deal; `always`, `context` or `context_requires_any` present but not a list of
    strings, null included; or an active deal that declares terms none of which survives
    normalization -- we cannot know what to look for);
  * `git log` / `git rev-list` / `git cat-file` fails (e.g. remote sha unknown locally --
    run `git fetch`);
  * a pushed ref or tag chain that ends at an object that is not a commit, tree or blob;
  * content that cannot be decoded reliably while a deal is active: a corrupt or encrypted
    archive, one over the size / member / depth caps, 7z / rar / zstd archives, and PDFs
    (PDF text is often compressed AND glyph-encoded, so no byte scan can prove it clean) --
    verify such a push by hand, then `git push --no-verify`;
  * ORA_PREPUSH_REQUIRE_REFS=1 and no ref lines arrived on stdin.
A roster with no active deal (all closed) allows every push without scanning, as does one
whose active deals carry no `always` and no `context` term at all (anchors alone cannot
block). An active deal with context terms and no always terms is SCANNED, never fast-pathed.

Residual (not covered):
  * text inside images, OCR-only scans, raw zlib / lzma-alone streams, PNG zTXt chunks, and
    encodings other than those listed above (URL-encoding nested past 4 rounds included);
  * a context term and its anchor split across two commits, or across two blobs of a tree
    pushed through a tag;
  * zero-width characters or combining marks inside an always / context term (anchors are
    tightened, terms are not);
  * URL-encoded or tag-split anchors with invisible characters inside (the tight reading
    covers the raw and entity-decoded text only);
  * a term interleaved with markup whose total span exceeds the slice overlap AND straddles a
    256 KB slice edge;
  * history the destination already advertises is not rescanned (it is already public). So
    a compromised or hostile destination that advertises arbitrary shas can exclude them;
    and ls-remote runs before the push itself, so a commit advertised at check time but
    removed from the destination before the push lands is not rescanned (race).

Exit 0 = allow, 1 = block (git pre-push convention). Bypass for a verified-clean push is a
human's `git push --no-verify`; there is deliberately no environment-variable bypass.
